# **About Me**

## **Biography**

Hello! I'm **Munashe Njanji**, a Computer Science graduate from the **National University of Science and Technology (NUST)** in Zimbabwe. I navigate the worlds of **software engineering**, **teaching**, and **emerging technologies** with equal passion. My background blends academic foundations, hands-on engineering, and real-world experimentation across multiple domains of modern computing.

Professionally, I work as a **Software Engineer** while also serving as a **High School Computer Science Teacher**, where I teach programming, problem-solving, and foundational computing principles to young, ambitious learners. This dual role gives me a unique vantage point: I get to build real systems while also shaping the next generation of African technologists.

I spend a lot of time working inside the **Ubuntu/Linux ecosystem**, building tools, experimenting with AI-powered workflows, exploring cybersecurity, and architecting full-stack applications. My interests span a wide technical spectrum:

* Advanced **AI systems**, including multimodal models and automated developer workflows
* Modern **web development**, with a focus on React, Tailwind, state management, component design, and deep integration with AI services
* **Cybersecurity**, privacy, secure systems architecture, and safe deployment practices
* **Mobile development**, from UX-driven apps to data-driven services
* **Big data** and high-performance distributed systems
* Linux-based development for reliability, tooling mastery, and deep system understanding

Across all my work, I pursue a balance between elegant engineering, practical system design, and forward-looking innovation. My long-term vision is to contribute to Africa's growing tech ecosystem—building tools, platforms, and systems that empower people, elevate education, and strengthen the regional developer community.
